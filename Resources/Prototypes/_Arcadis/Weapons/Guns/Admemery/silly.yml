  description: "In the process of making the Core Eject shotgun, Nanotrasen figured out how to compress pure heat into objects. A deranged engineer made this in the process: a Laser Rifle with a modification that allows it to alternately fire plungers. For obvious reasons, it never actually made it into production."
